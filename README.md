# JobMonitor
An application which allows users to create and edit jobs, including details for the job date, job name, and job description.

The UI updates in real-time as changes are made. For example, if an existing job is opened and the description is edited, as soon as the change is saved, the job description in the job list for that job is updated.

This application also interfaces with an SQL Server database to store and retrieve job data from, however this is still a work-in-progress.
